The project involves using Bayesian Inference for tracking and capturing invisible ghosts, where Pacman is equipped with a sensor for noisy readings of the distance to each ghost. The objective is to develop inference algorithms for accurately tracking the ghosts using Bayes Nets. The project aims to utilize exact and approximate inference techniques to aid Pacman in successfully capturing the invisible ghosts.
